## My process
I started building the design with mobile first approach. I used flexbox to align the elements as per the design layout. I used css variables to avoid repeating the styles.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt how to center the main element using flexbox on screen and learned how to use universal selectors.

### Continued development

I want to dive more deeper into the media queries and design principles like typography, spacing and colors.
